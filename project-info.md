# Top 5 Most Important and Prioritized Features

## 1. AI-Powered Multi-Source Sentiment Analysis
**Core Function:** This is the absolute foundation. The application must effectively leverage Gemini AI to analyze sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) from both e-commerce product reviews (Amazon, Noon, Salla) and social media brand mentions (Instagram, X, potentially Snapchat).
**Why it's #1:** Without accurate and comprehensive sentiment analysis across these diverse sources, the application has no unique value.

## 2. Unified Data Ingestion & Centralized Storage
**Core Function:** A robust system to scrape/collect review data from specified e-commerce platforms and brand mentions from social media APIs. This data needs to be stored efficiently in a centralized database.
**Why it's #2:** You can't analyze what you don't have. Efficient, reliable, and scalable data collection is paramount, and RapidAPI integration for initial data sources is key for MVP.

## 3. Interactive Dashboard with Holistic Brand & Product Metrics
**Core Function:** A user-friendly dashboard (built with Shadcn UI) that displays key aggregated metrics (Total Reviews/Mentions, Overall Sentiment Score, Average Rating) and sentiment distribution visualizations (pie/bar charts). It must clearly differentiate between marketplace and social media data, as well as provide an overall brand health view.
**Why it's #3:** This is how users consume insights. A clear, intuitive, and comprehensive overview is essential for quick understanding and high-level decision-making.

## 4. Granular Drill-Down with Specific Insights & Keyword Extraction
**Core Function:** The ability for users to dig deeper from high-level metrics into specific reviews or social media mentions. This includes identifying particular products mentioned in social media, quantifying negative sentiment for specific products (e.g., "13 people disliked X product on Snapchat"), and extracting top positive/negative keywords/phrases across all data sources.
**Why it's #4:** This provides the "actionable feedback." Store owners need to know what customers are saying and where those sentiments originate to improve.

## 5. Customizable Report Generation & PDF Export
**Core Function:** Allow users to generate and export professional, customizable PDF reports based on selected filters (date range, platform, product, sentiment).
**Why it's #5:** While not directly an "insight," the ability to share and document these findings is crucial for internal reporting, presentations, and justifying changes within the store owner's organization. It solidifies the value proposition by providing a tangible output.
